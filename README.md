# Recommender systems

Make article recommendations to users of the IBM Watson Studio platform based on user interactions with the site. Three kinds of recommenders are [explored](https://github.com/sunnykan/ibm-recommendations/tree/main/ibm_recommendations).
- Rank based
- User-User based collaborative filtering
- Matrix factorization

For a sample run, clone the repository, open the [ibm-recommendations](https://github.com/sunnykan/ibm-recommendations) folder and type `python Recommendations_with_IBM.py`.
